# How to build this example ?

This example is intended to be compiled with [Codelite](https://codelite.org).

[Codelite](https://codelite.org) is a free cross-platform software...

If you want to compile it without codelite, you can do it with [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) :

		make -f modbus-gateway.mk

Nevertheless, i am not sure that it works on Windows™ and macOS™.

You can then run the program that is in the Debug folder.
